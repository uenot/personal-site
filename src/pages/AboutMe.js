      <div>
        <p>I am Toby Ueno, a 17-year-old high school student who has taken up coding as a hobby.</p>
        <p>
          I wrote my first line of code a year ago as part of a Computer Science course, and since then I've
          learned and grown tremendously as a programmer.
        </p>
        <p>The programming languages I know are Python, JavaScript, and Java, in order of familiarity.</p>
        <p>I also have experience with HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>
          Some of my favorite libraries to work with are Selenium, React, and pandas.
        </p>
