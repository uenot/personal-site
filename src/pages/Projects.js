          This collection of scripts was written to manage Yahoo fantasy football teams. It can draft a team based
          on custom or pre-determined rankings and dynamic position weighting, and it can automatically send, parse,
          and accept or reject trades.

          The project was written in Python, and features Selenium to navigate and manipulate the website.
          Other libraries used include BeautifulSoup for web scraping and pandas for data analysis.

          NocturneTS is a full text-based recreation of the turn-based combat found in the 2003 video
          game <ExternalLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shin_Megami_Tensei_III:_Nocturne">Shin

          The program features multiple game modes that involve user input and a fully-automated "experiment mode"
          that can simulate thousands of games with custom settings.
