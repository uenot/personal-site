      <p>
        This site was created with the goal of practicing web design.
      </p>
      <p>
        The frontend was constructed through <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a> using functional components.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <code>react-router-dom</code> package was used for reload-free pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, all elements of the site were written in HTML/CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this project, I learned about React and NodeJS and gained more experience with practical
        implementations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        The source code for this website is
        available <a href="https://github.com/uenot/personal-site">in this GitHub repo</a>.
      </p>
    </div>
